# Amazon-Web-Scraper
A web scraper I made in Python to make quick Amazon searches for me given an item name, maximum price, and how many results I wish to see (example: only top 10 results)

NOTE: The web scraper may work differently depending on your web browser's version. The scraper will work best on only the newest version of browser.
